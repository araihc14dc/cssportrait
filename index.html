            I got my driver's license last week
            Just like we always talked about
            'Cause you were so excited for me
            To finally drive up to your house
            But today I drove through the suburbs
            Cryin' 'cause you weren't around
            And you're probably with that blonde girl
            Who always made me doubt
            She's so much older than me
            She's everything I'm insecure about
            Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
            'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
            And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
            Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
            And all my friends are tired
            Of hearing how much I miss you, but
            I kinda feel sorry for them
            'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
            Today I drove through the suburbs
            And pictured I was driving home to you
            And I know we weren't perfect
            But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
            I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
            Red lights, stop signs
            I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
            Can't drive past the places we used to go to
            'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
            Sidewalks we crossed
            I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
            Over all the noise
            God, I'm so blue, know we're through
            But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
            I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
            'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
            Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
            Ooh-ooh-ooh
            Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
            Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
            Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
            That you'd talk to her, maybe did even worse
            I kept quiet so I could keep you
            And ain't it funny
            How you ran to her
            The second that we called it quits?
            And ain't it funny
            How you said you were friends?
            Now it sure as hell don't look like it
            You betrayed me
            And I know that you'll never feel sorry
            For the way I hurt, yeah
            You'd talk to her
            When we were together
            Loved you at your worst
            But that didn't matter
            It took you two weeks
            To go off and date her
            Guess you didn't cheat
            But you're still a traitor
            Now you bring her around
            Just to shut me down
            Show her off like she's a new trophy
            And I know if you were true
            There's no damn way that you
            Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
            Ain't it funny
            All the twisted games
            All the questions you used to avoid?
            Ain't it funny?
            Remember I brought her up
            And you told me I was paranoid
            You betrayed me
            And I know that you'll never feel sorry
            For the way I hurt, yeah
            You'd talk to her
            When we were together
            Loved you at your worst
            But that didn't matter
            It took you two weeks
            To go off and date her
            Guess you didn't cheat
            But you're still a traitor
            God, I wish that you had thought this through
            Before I went and fell in love with you
            (Ah-ah-ah)
            When she's sleeping in the bed we made
            Don't you dare forget about the way
            You betrayed me
            'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
            For the way I hurt, yeah
            You'd talk to her
            When we were together
            You gave me your word
            But that didn't matter
            It took you two weeks
            To go off and date her
            Guess you didn't cheat
            But you're still
            You're still a traitor (ah-ah-ah)
            Yeah, you're still a traitor
            Ooh-ooh-ooh
            God, I wish that you had thought this through
            Before I went and fell in love with you
